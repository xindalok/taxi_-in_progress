### Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to analyzing municipal expenditures on Snow and Ice removal in the year 2022.

The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:

1. Using Python, perform EDA on the taxi data from the New York City TLC to get a general understanding of what taxi ridership looks like

2. I would suggest at the very least a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month. Whatever you think makes the most sense.

3. Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. Weâ€™ve found these to be particularly helpful in status reports to the client and board members. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isnâ€™t data savvy and remember that the assistant director at the New York City TLC is a person with visual impairments.

4. it would be really helpful if you included an executive summary of your analysis attached via email.
